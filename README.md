[00:00.09] Ah, let's raise our glasses to the lovely world we live in
[00:03.29] Hear the sound of laughter lacking inhibition
[00:06.19] All pretending they don't see the cold reality they're escaping
[00:10.32] It's driving me crazy
[00:20.82] 
[00:11.93] There's something in the air that's sweet and unforgiving
[00:14.58] Piercing through my nose until my head is spinning
[00:17.35] Like a missing link making primal instincts awaken
[00:21.54] So who'll be taken next?
[00:33.54] 
[00:23.70] It's so cruel, but what can I do?
[00:25.49] Our world is conflictual, but what can I do?
[00:28.32] Don't let the tears keep flowing down from your eyes
[00:31.28] That are so black, I've lost myself so deep inside
[00:56.28] 
[00:34.26] Ah, reaching and clinging tight onto a future
[00:37.32] That I have wished for time and time again
[00:39.61] 'Cause in a world so full of horrible misfortune
[00:43.62] I just want you to smile again
[00:45.79] So I promise, I'm not gonna hurt anyone
[00:48.77] I'll get stronger and stronger still
[00:50.65] 'Til I've got the power to stay true to myself
[01:13.65] 
[01:02.64] Today's so peaceful in this lovely world we live in
[01:05.32] Terrifying news I cannot bear to listen
[01:08.05] So I tune it out, tune it out, act like I haven't heard it
[01:12.60] Maybe it's insanity
[01:22.10] 
[01:13.98] The march of a protest that is dressed to kill
[01:16.66] As they stomp and rumble, stepping, never standing still
[01:19.38] And there's a horrid taste
[01:20.44] Like a stain, every single thing that it touches
[01:23.98] It lingers in the underworld
[01:37.98] 
[01:36.52] Living your entire life so righteous and pure
[01:38.95] And keeping everybody happy with a charming allure
[01:41.76] While living honestly, sticking to the path that you take
[01:44.61] But is that really living without making any mistakes?
[02:11.61] 
[01:47.45] So tell me, is it right to live my life the way that I am?
[01:50.35] And tell me, is it right to pull out every trick that I can?
[01:53.03] Can anybody tell me what it is I'm meant to be?
[01:55.18] 'Cause I don't know who it is, I really am
[01:58.34] Won't somebody tell me?
[02:03.99] Will somebody tell me?
[02:14.99] 
[02:09.82] So today in a world that doesn't have the answers
[02:13.54] I only wish that you someday will find them after all
[02:16.88] And even though I'm awkward
[02:18.96] I just want to laugh with you endlessly
[02:21.93] Can you hear it?
[02:23.03] The way that you're shaking
[02:24.28] Your body is causing your heart to shout
[02:26.75] Now has come the time for us to run, ah
[02:46.25] 
[02:30.25] All of the weakness I have felt before now
[02:33.27] I will keep on devouring 'til it's gone
[02:35.52] 'Cause in a world so full of horrible misfortune
[02:39.51] I just want you to smile again
[02:41.42] So I promise that no one will cry anymore
[02:44.54] I'll get stronger and stronger still
[02:46.56] 'Til I've got the power to stay true to myself
[03:09.56] 
[03:00.82] I will protect you, no matter the cost to my body
[03:03.72] For that I'll keep running and running still
[03:06.23] 'Til I've got the power to exceed my limits
